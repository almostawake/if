# Deploys & Google credentials (outbound)

Everything about talking **to** Google from this checkout: deploying, and getting bearer tokens for GCP/Firebase REST or admin calls. (The inbound `api` bearer secret is a different, unrelated token — see CLAUDE-API.md.)

## `.env` — which project, which account

`.env` (gitignored, 1:1 with checkout — no dev/test/prod split) carries:

- `THIS_PROJECT_ID_ON_GOOGLE_HOSTING` — the Google Cloud project this checkout deploys to.
- `THIS_PROJECT_REGION_ON_GOOGLE_HOSTING` — the immutable Firestore location; the functions build bakes it into `functions/src/region.ts` (see CLAUDE-STACK.md → Region).
- `EMAIL_OF_GOOGLE_HOSTING_ACCOUNT` — picks the cred file at `~/.if/creds/google.<email>.json` for both `cmd-auth.mjs` (when no positional arg) and `cmd-deploy.mjs`.

If missing, write them manually.

## Deploying — `npm run deploy*` (the wrapper handles auth itself)

Deploys go through `npm run deploy:<target>` — names are self-explanatory (`deploy`, `deploy:hosting`, `deploy:functions`, `deploy:rules`, `deploy:indexes`).

The wrapper (`cmd-deploy.mjs`) reads the OAuth refresh token from `~/.if/creds/google.<EMAIL_OF_GOOGLE_HOSTING_ACCOUNT>.json`, materialises a temporary `.adc.json`, points `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` at it, and runs `firebase deploy` for you. **You don't need to fetch a token first** — the wrapper does it. Don't pre-call `cmd-auth.mjs --token` before deploying; it's pointless and can mask issues.

**Don't deploy by:** calling `firebase deploy` directly (no creds in scope), curl-ing googleapis REST endpoints, or shelling around the wrapper. Always `npm run deploy*`.

`firebase deploy` and `firebase emulators:*` flow through the auth-blocking hook fine; only the *login* sub-commands are blocked. Build is wired into `firebase.json`'s hosting `predeploy` so it runs automatically when hosting is in scope.

**Multi-account deploy:** `EMAIL_OF_GOOGLE_HOSTING_ACCOUNT=alice@x.com npm run deploy:functions` picks up `~/.if/creds/google.alice@x.com.json` for that one run.

Do NOT deploy unless the user explicitly asks.

## Google API calls — `cmd-auth.mjs`

For ANY GCP or Firebase REST/admin call from this project — listing projects, reading Firestore, calling Cloud Functions admin APIs, reading logs, anything that needs a Google bearer token — get the token via `cmd-auth.mjs`. The canonical pattern, verbatim:

```sh
TOKEN=$(node cmd-auth.mjs --token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects | jq .
```

`cmd-auth.mjs --token` probes / refreshes / re-grants as needed (logs to stderr) and prints the access_token to stdout. Non-zero exit on failure so callers can error-check.

**When listing projects**, filter out projects pending deletion (`lifecycleState != "ACTIVE"`) and Apps Script-managed projects (project IDs prefixed with `sys-`, or `parent.type == "firebaseAppScript"`). They clutter results and are never deploy targets. A jq filter like `.projects[] | select(.lifecycleState == "ACTIVE" and (.projectId | startswith("sys-") | not))` is usually enough.

**Cred storage:** all OAuth creds live at `~/.if/creds/google.<email>.json` — out-of-tree, one file per Google account, chmod 600. Never in the project. There is no "default" file; the account always comes from either a positional arg or `EMAIL_OF_GOOGLE_HOSTING_ACCOUNT` in `.env`.

**Multi-account:** pass the email as a positional arg — `node cmd-auth.mjs alice@x.com --token` — uses `~/.if/creds/google.alice@x.com.json`. Add a new account with `npm run auth -- alice@x.com`. Probe-only check: `npm run auth:status` (or `node cmd-auth.mjs alice@x.com --status`).

## Hard rules — the failure modes that bite fresh sessions

- **Never** read a cred file directly to pluck out an access_token. The stored token is usually expired; the file is meant to be consumed via `cmd-auth.mjs`.
- **Never** roll your own refresh — no manual `POST` to `oauth2.googleapis.com/token`, no hand-written exchange of refresh_token for access_token. `cmd-auth.mjs` is the one place that does that, and it writes the refreshed tokens back atomically.
- **Never** suggest `gcloud auth login`, `firebase login`, or `firebase-tools login` — they manage a separate auth state this project ignores, they're blocked by `.claude/hook-block-direct-auth.mjs`, and the user would be re-authenticating something this project doesn't read.
- If `cmd-auth.mjs --token` itself fails (network error, browser timeout on a fresh consent), surface the error — don't try to bypass it.

## Daily re-consent prompts (Workspace accounts)

These aren't a refresh-token revocation — they're Google Cloud session control (the `cloud-platform` scope is governed by it). Refresh returns `invalid_grant` with `error_subtype: invalid_rapt`; `cmd-auth.mjs` labels the case so you can tell which is which. There's no in-code fix (RAPT can't be satisfied without a fresh user grant from a first-party tool). Permanent cure: admin.google.com → Security → Access and data control → Google Cloud session control → set "Session never expires" (or extend) on your account/OU.
